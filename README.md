# Excess mortality

## Collection of functions for the calculations of excess mortality for use in the PandemiX research group

This repository contains python code for calculating excess mortality from historical mortality data.

Most functions assumes data is available both before and after events in questions, and hence the functions here are only relevant for historical data, and _not_ for modern data. 

Currently most functionality is missing, and will be added later.
